    <body><h3>Annie</h3>
    <p><h4>In the depths of the 1930s, Annie (Aileen Quinn) is a fiery young orphan girl who must live in a miserable orphanage run by the 
        tyrannical Miss Agatha Hannigan. Her seemingly hopeless situation changes dramatically when she is selected to spend a short time 
        at the residence of the wealthy munitions industrialist, Oliver "Daddy" Warbucks. 
        Quickly, she charms the hearts of the household staff and even the seemingly cold-hearted Warbucks cannot help but learn to love 
        this wonderful girl. He decides to help Annie find her long-lost parents by offering a reward if they would come to him and prove 
        their identity. 
        However, Miss Agatha Hannigan, her evil brother, Daniel Francis "Rooster" Hannigan, and a female accomplice, plan to impersonate 
        those people to get the reward for themselves, which puts Annie in great danger.
